# Decision Tree Algorithm :thinking:

Before going down to the topic, lets learn about **Machine Learning**:
## What is Machine Learning? :confused:
<br>As per the name Machine(Computers) learn about the data. They apply tools, techniques and algorithms to study(Learning) the patterns hidden in the data to make accurate predictions and deliver the output to the users.
<br>To learn from the data, there are various ways or types.
### Types of Machine Learning: :shushing_face:
1)**Supervised Learning**: 
The basic idea that goes with is that there is a teacher or supervisor who guides the whole process, Similarly, here we train the machine with labeled to predict the outcome for a newly unseen data. Labeled data means data is already paired with some correct answers.
<br>2) **Unsupervised Learning**:
Here, we do not train the machine rather we leave the machine to study on its own and discover the hidden patterns in the data. Unsupervised Learning deals with unlabeled data. 

<br>As mentioned above machine apply some algorithms to study the data, these two types of learning have some algorithms. So, we are here today to learn about **Decision Tree Algorithm** which is a supervised learning.

<br>The **Decision Tree Algorithm** is similar to the if-else statements in looping. Decision Tree is the graphical representation of answers to our own problems which we come across daily in our life based upon some conditions.
<br> Its uses tree like structure where our problem is the parent node or root node. The parentnode is the point where branches orginiates which means the possible outcomes or solutions. Next comes the chance node which represents the uncertain solution. The last part of the Decision Tree is the leaf node which indicates the final solution to our problem.
